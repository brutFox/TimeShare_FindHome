Consider developing an online property marketing website where users and vendors sell, rent and own real estate properties. 
A time share property is a real property or home which people own. Developers build these properties, and sell to people 
through real estate agents, using a system called TimeShare, that you will build.

Builders and developers, and users list the properties they own or agents list them  on behalf of owners and developers to
sell, or rent. Homes are thus categorized as a rental or for sale homes. Every owner (builder or user) has a set of rules 
or conditions that each potential customers must satisfy. Customers submit a bid including all the required documentation 
that are required by the seller, including a processing fee. Once the bid is submitted, all matching homes are listed for 
a client, and once a bid is accepted, a separate list of accepted bids are displayed. A client can set how many accepted 
bid he/she wants to receive, but a builder owner cannot accept more than one client per property. Each client has a time 
limit to accept an offer of purchase against their bids. Once the time expires, client cannot buy the property.

In TimeShare, both customers and sellers have a choice. The choice being buy or not to buy by the customers, and sell and
not to sell by the owners. In this application, owners put up their homes for which they specify the requirements a 
customer must satisfy to be accepted as a client/customer. Those requirements may include a set of reference letters from 
other clients whom the seller trusts, documents they must receive, attributes of the customers and deadlines by which several
decisions will have to be made. Once all the requirements are met, the owners take the decisions, by the deadlines. Customers 
are notified, and they select the homes they like. Once a selection is made, owners send necessary documentation to the 
customers.
